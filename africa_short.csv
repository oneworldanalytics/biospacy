"EXPERIMENTS WITH A VIRUS DISEASE OF THE COTTON BOLLWORM HELIOTHIS ARMIGERA (HBN . Laboratory tests with a nuclear polyhedral virus disease of Heliothis armigera indicated that it was more infective and had a shorter incubation period in the younger instars than in the older larvae. Larvae on cotton plants sprayed with an aqueous suspension of the virus became infected; mortality depended on the number of polyhedra applied to the plant irrespective of the concentration in the suspension. Spraying with the virus seems unlikely to control bollworm in Uganda, but might do so where it is not already endemic and where bollworm numbers fluctuate more during the year.",1
"PECTIC ENZYMES SECRETED BY VERTICILLIUM DAHLIAE AND THEIR ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WILT DISEASE OF COTTON . An isolate of Verticillium dahliae obtained from Uganda was highly virulent to young cotton plants under greenhouse conditions. A hyaline variant which often appeared in culture was as virulent as the parent isolate, but preliminary experiments indicated that it did not survive as long in unsterile soil. The parent isolate grew rapidly in cotton plants after root inoculation and was isolated from stems and leaves well before the appearance of disease symptoms visible to the naked eye. Protopectinase was produced in the absence of pectic materials, but more active preparations were obtained when media contained pectic substances. In general, there was a close correspondence between the protopectinase activity of culture filtrates and the toxicity of these filtrates to parenchymatous cells. Some separation of the two activities was obtained by heating enzyme solutions or by plasmolysing the test tissue. Protopectinase solutions had little pectinesterase activity but rapidly reduced the viscosity of solutions of pectic substances. In general, the properties of protopectinase and the viscosity-reducing enzyme were similar. Young cotton shoots wilted rapidly when placed in cell-free filtrates from cultures of the pathogen. Wilting was delayed under conditions unfavourable for transpiration. Evidence was obtained which showed that wilting was caused by the uptake of thermostable compounds of high molecular weight which impeded the upward flow of the vascular sap. Pronounced vascular browning was obtained only when solutions containing protopectinase were used. Wilting and vascular browning were obtained with solutions having little pectinesterase activity; in contrast, a solution having high pectinesterase activity produced relatively little vascular browning.",2
"VASCULAR INFECTION OF COTTON BY XANTHOMONAS MALVACEARUM (E. F. SMITH) DOWSON . Cotton seedlings raised under glass from seed pre-soaked in a water suspension of Xanthomonas malvacearum, and watered by sub-irrigation only, developed atypical dull green flaccid areas extending from the periphery of the cotyledons. Later symptoms that variably developed were : vascular discoloration, not necessarily continuous, in the petioles of affected cotyledons, in the hypocotyl, and in parts of the plant above the cotyledonary node; premature withering of cotyledons; dull green flaccid areas in true leaves, not necessarily the lowest, later turning brown and drying, with usually a chlorotic margin; parenchymatous attack in stems, petioles and leaves. Evidence is adduced, from the progression of symptoms and from associations between them, and from isolations of the pathogen from various parts of the plant at different stages, that the course of this type of infection is primarily vascular, progressing from the edges of cotyledons into the hypocotyl and thence upwards in vascular tissues. Thence the infection may break out at any time into parenchymatous tissues, leading to the more characteristic forms of the disease, of greater or less severity according to the susceptibility of the parenchyma at the time of its invasion. Similar symptoms have been observed in field plantings, and it is suggested that vascular infection is of greater and wider significance in the epidemiology of bacterial blight than has hitherto been commonly accepted.",3
"Chemical composition and anti-termitic activity of essential oil from Canarium schweinfurthii Engl . An essential oil extract from resin of Canarium schweinfurthii from Saw Bay Area, Southern Uganda, was prepared by steam distillation. The chemical composition of the oil was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. Monoterpenes were the main constituents. The oil's composition was found to be different from previously reported C. schweinfurthii oils from Central African Republic, Cameroon and Gabon. The oil was tested for anti-termitic activity against Macrotermes bellicosus and found to be highly potent with an LC50 (48 h) of 1.12 mg/g. Commercial samples of some of the oil's major constituents (gamma-terpinene, alpha-phellandrene,p-cymene and sabinene) were tested individually and showed high anti-termitic activity.

"The impact of maternal infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis on the infant response to bacille Calmette-Guerin immunization . Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) immunization provides variable protection against tuberculosis. Prenatal antigen exposure may have lifelong effects on responses to related antigens and pathogens. We therefore hypothesized that maternal latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (LTBI) influences infant responses to BCG immunization at birth. We measured antibody (n = 53) and cellular (n = 31) responses to M. tuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPD) in infants of mothers with and without LTBI, in cord blood and at one and six weeks after BCG. The concentrations of PPD-specific antibodies declined between birth (median [interquartile range (IQR)]) 5600 ng ml(-1) [3300-11 050] in cord blood) and six weeks (0.00 ng ml(-1) [0-288]). Frequencies of PPD-specific IFN-gamma-expressing CD4(+)T cells increased at one week and declined between one and six weeks (p = 0.031). Frequencies of IL-2-and TNF-alpha-expressing PPD-specific CD4+T cells increased between one and six weeks (p = 0.019, p = 0.009, respectively). At one week, the frequency of PPD-specific CD4+T cells expressing any of the three cytoldnes, combined, was lower among infants of mothers with LTBI, in crude analyses (p = 0.002) and after adjusting for confounders (mean difference, 95% CI 0.041% (-0.082, -0.001)). In conclusion, maternal LTBI was associated with lower infant anti-mycobacterial T-cell responses immediately following BCG immunization. These findings are being explored further in a larger study.",5
"Vaccines against human papillomavirus in low and middle income countries: a review of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy . Currently, there is limited data on the immunogenicity and efficacy of human papillomavirus vaccines in Low and Middle income countries (LMIC). The review aims to summarize the current status from published HPV vaccine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy studies in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE and HINARI) were searched for peer reviewed English language articles on HPV vaccination in LMIC that have so far been published from 1st January 2006 up to 30th January 2015. Eligible studies were included if they had used the bivalent (bHPV) or quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccines in a LMIC and investigated safety, immunogenicity and/or efficacy. The main findings were extracted and summarized. A total of fourteen HPV vaccine studies assessing safety, Immunogenicity and efficacy of the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccines in LMIC were included. There are only ten published clinical trials where a LMIC has participated. There was no published study so far that assessed efficacy of the HPV vaccines in Sub-Saharan Africa. From these studies, vaccine induced immune response was comparable to that from results of HICs for all age groups. Studies assessing HPV vaccine efficacy of the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine within LMIC were largely missing. Only three studies were found where a LMIC was part of a multi center clinical trial. In all the studies, there were no vaccine related serious adverse events. The findings from the only study that investigated less than three doses of the bivalent HPV-16/18 vaccine suggest that even with less than three doses, antibody levels were still comparable with older women where efficacy has been proven. The few studies from LMIC in this review had comparable safety, Immunogenicity and efficacy profiles like in HIC. Overall, the LMIC of Africa where immune compromising/modulating situations are prevalent, there is need for long term immunogenicity as well as surveillance studies for long term clinical effectiveness after two and three dose regimens.",6
"Occurrence of porcine cysticercosis in free-ranging pigs delivered to slaughter points in Arapai, Soroti district, Uganda . Poverty, hunger and the need for production of pigs with meagre or zero inputs have made most farmers release their pigs to range freely, thus creating a pig-human cycle that maintains Taenia solium, the pig tapeworm and cause of porcine cysticercosis, in the ecosystem. A preliminary study was designed to establish the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis by postmortem examination of the tongue and carcass of free-range pigs from February to April 2014 in Arapai subcounty, Soroti district, eastern Uganda. The tongue of each pig was extended and examined before deep incisions were made and the cut surfaces were examined. The rest of the carcasses were examined for cysts. Out of 178 pigs examined, 32 were qualitatively positive for porcine cysticercosis, representing a prevalence of 18.0%. This high prevalence represents a marked risk to the communities in the study area of neurocysticercosis, a debilitating parasitic zoonosis. Proper human waste disposal by use of pit latrines, confinement of free-range pigs and treatment with albendazole and oxfendazole are recommended.",7
"Infection and exposure to vector-borne pathogens in rural dogs and their ticks, Uganda . Background: In rural parts of Africa, dogs live in close association with humans and livestock, roam freely, and usually do not receive prophylactic measures. Thus, they are a source of infectious disease for humans and for wildlife such as protected carnivores. In 2011, an epidemiological study was carried out around three conservation areas in Uganda to detect the presence and determine the prevalence of vector-borne pathogens in rural dogs and associated ticks to evaluate the risk that these pathogens pose to humans and wildlife. Methods: Serum samples (n = 105), blood smears (n = 43) and blood preserved on FTA cards (n = 38) and ticks (58 monospecific pools of Haemaphysalis leachi and Rhipicephalus praetextatus including 312 ticks from 52 dogs) were collected from dogs. Dog sera were tested by indirect immunofluorescence to detect the presence of antibodies against Rickettsia conorii and Ehrlichia canis. Antibodies against R. conorii were also examined by indirect enzyme immunoassay. Real time PCR for the detection of Rickettsia spp., Anaplasmataceae, Bartonella spp. and Babesia spp. was performed in DNA extracted from FTA cards and ticks. Results: 99 % of the dogs were seropositive to Rickettsia spp. and 29.5 % to Ehrlichia spp. Molecular analyses revealed that 7.8 % of the blood samples were infected with Babesia rossi, and all were negative for Rickettsia spp. and Ehrlichia spp. Ticks were infected with Rickettsia sp. (18.9 %), including R. conorii and R. massiliae; Ehrlichia sp. (18.9 %), including E. chaffeensis and Anaplasma platys; and B. rossi (1.7 %). Bartonella spp. was not detected in any of the blood or tick samples. Conclusions: This study confirms the presence of previously undetected vector-borne pathogens of humans and animals in East Africa. We recommend that dog owners in rural Uganda be advised to protect their animals against ectoparasites to prevent the transmission of pathogens to humans and wildlife.",8
"Phenotypic expression and prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in samples collected from patients in various wards of Mulago Hospital, Uganda . Background: Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins among Enterobacteriaceae has been reported yet they serve as the last line treatment for severe infections in Uganda and other countries. This resistance often leads to nosocomial infection outbreaks and therapeutic failures from multidrug resistant bacteria. The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in clinical samples of patients in various wards of Mulago Hospital; Uganda's main national referral and teaching hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between January-April, 2014. Purposive consecutive sampling was used to collect pus swab, urine, blood and CSF samples from patients in the various wards. A total of 245 consecutive, non-repetitive, clinical samples were obtained and tested for phenotypic ESBL production using the Double Disc Synergy Test using cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime-clavulanic acid and ceftazidime-clavulanic acid. Results: Results show that 47 % of the 245 samples had Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Of these isolates 62 % were ESBL producers while 38 % were of non-ESBL phenotype. E. coli was the most isolated organism (53.9 %), followed by K. pneumoniae (28.7 %). Majority of Enterobacteriaceae organisms were isolated from urine samples, followed by pus samples and of these 64.9 % and 47.4 % were ESBL-producers respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae had the highest percentage of ESBL producers (72.7 %). There was a higher percentage of isolates showing resistance to ceftazidime (73 %) compared to cefotaxime (57.5 %). All Enterobacter cloacae isolates showed resistance to ceftazidime. There were no statistically significant association between phenotype (ESBL/non-ESBL) and patients' age or gender or Enterobacteriaceae spp. Conclusions: This study reveals a high prevalence of ESBL producing organisms in Mulago Hospital and high levels of resistance to third generation cephalosporins. In addition to undertaking appropriate infection control measures, there is urgent need for formulation of an antibiotic policy in Uganda to prevent spread of these organisms. This also calls for continuous monitoring and reporting of the presence of such organisms in order to ensure rational and judicious use of antibiotics by clinicians.",9
"Tropical and travel-related dermatomycoses. Part 1: Dermatophytoses . ""Today, tropical and travel-related dermatomycoses must be increasingly anticipated to present in dermatological offices and clinics. Skin infections due to dermatophytes or other fungi may occur after a journey in countries with a high prevalence for the respective causative fungal pathogen, e.g., tinea corporis due to Trichophyton soudanense. Otherwise, more frequently, single infections and even localized outbreaks due to """"exotic"""" or """"imported"""" pathogens of dermatophytoses occur. These epidemics are observed in childcare facilities in Germany and in other European countries. Source of infection are immigrants from Africa and sometimes from Asian countries. Furthermore, African children, and sometimes also adults, are often only asymptomatic carriers of such anthropophilic dermatophytes. Outbreaks of dermatophyte infections with one and more affected children and also adult staff and teachers due to Trichophyton violaceum or Microsporum audouinii in kindergartens and schools are not a rarity these days. Further tropical and travel-associated dermatophytes are Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton schoenleinii, and Trichophyton concentricum. Tinea capitis should be treated in a species-specific manner. Griseofulvin is the treatment of choice for infections due to Microsporum species. In contrast, tinea capitis due to Trichophyton species has to be treated by terbinafine, however, because the agent is not approved for children in Germany, only after receiving written consent of parents. Alternatives are fluconazole and itraconazole. Onset and aggravation of tinea pedis during travel has its origin in a preexisting neglected fungal infection of the feet. In the tropics, exacerbations and secondary bacterial complications of tinea pedis develop under distinctly promoting conditions.""",10
"Correlates between Models of Virulence for Mycobacterium tuberculosis among Isolates of the Central Asian Lineage: a Case for Lysozyme Resistance Testing . Virulence factors (VFs) contribute to the emergence of new human Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, are lineage dependent, and are relevant to the development of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drugs/vaccines. VFs were sought within Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage 3, which has the Central Asian (CAS) spoligotype. Three isolates were selected from clusters previously identified as dominant in London, United Kingdom. Strain-associated virulence was studied in guinea pig, monocyte-derived macrophage, and lysozyme resistance assays. Whole-genome sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, and a literature review contributed to the identification of SNPs of interest. The animal model revealed borderline differences in strain-associated pathogenicity. Ex vivo, isolate C72 exhibited statistically significant differences in intracellular growth relative to C6 and C14. SNP candidates inducing lower fitness levels included 123 unique nonsynonymous SNPs, including three located in genes (lysX, caeA, and ponA2) previously identified as VFs in the laboratory-adapted reference strain H37Rv and shown to confer lysozyme resistance. C72 growth was most affected by lysozyme in vitro. A BLAST search revealed that all three SNPs of interest (C35F, P76Q, and P780R) also occurred in Tiruvallur, India, and in Uganda. Unlike C72, however, no single isolate identified through BLAST carried all three SNPs simultaneously. CAS isolates representative of three medium-sized human clusters demonstrated differential outcomes in models commonly used to estimate strain-associated virulence, supporting the idea that virulence varies within, not just across, Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineages. Three VF SNPs of interest were identified in two additional locations worldwide, which suggested independent selection and supported a role for these SNPs in virulence. The relevance of lysozyme resistance to strain virulence remains to be established.",11
"Contrasting effects of shade level and altitude on two important coffee pests . The diversity and abundance of natural enemies of insect pests is often higher in agroforestry plantations than in sun-exposed monocultures, and it is often assumed that this will lead to improved pest suppression. The effect that incorporating trees in cropping systems will have on pest populations, however, also depends on the habitat requirements of the pests themselves. In Eastern Uganda, we studied how shade level (full > 50 trees per acre, moderate 21-50 trees per acre, and low 0-20 trees per acre) and altitude (high 1,717-1,840 m.a.s.l. and low 1,511-1,605 m.a.s.l.) influenced the abundance of the white stem borer Monochamus leuconotus and the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei. We found that the effect of shade trees differed between the two pest species. The coffee berry borer was more common on sun-exposed plantations, whereas the white stem borer was more common in shaded plantations. Furthermore, the effect of shade level on the white stem borer depended on altitude, with the differences between shade levels being most pronounced in plantations at low altitudes. This implies that the impact of agroforestry on pest regulation both under current conditions and in a global warming scenario will be highly context dependent; it will depend on the identity of the most important pests in the area, and on environmental factors such as altitude.",12

"Trading or coercion? Variation in male mating strategies between two communities of East African chimpanzees . Across taxa, males employ a variety of mating strategies, including sexual coercion and the provision, or trading, of resources. Biological market theory (BMT) predicts that trading of commodities for mating opportunities should exist only when males cannot monopolize access to females and/or obtain mating by force, in situations where power differentials between males are low; both coercion and trading have been reported for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Here, we investigate whether the choice of strategy depends on the variation in male power differentials, using data from two wild communities of East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii): the structurally despotic Sonso community (Budongo, Uganda) and the structurally egalitarian M-group (Mahale, Tanzania). We found evidence of sexual coercion by male Sonso chimpanzees, and of trading-of grooming for mating-by M-group males; females traded sex for neither meat nor protection from male aggression. Our results suggest that the despotism-egalitarian axis influences strategy choice: male chimpanzees appear to pursue sexual coercion when power differentials are large and trading when power differentials are small and coercion consequently ineffective. Our findings demonstrate that trading and coercive strategies are not restricted to particular chimpanzee subspecies; instead, their occurrence is consistent with BMT predictions. Our study raises interesting, and as yet unanswered, questions regarding female chimpanzees' willingness to trade sex for grooming, if doing so represents a compromise to their fundamentally promiscuous mating strategy. It highlights the importance of within-species cross-group comparisons and the need for further study of the relationship between mating strategy and dominance steepness.",14
"Novel sequence types of non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli isolated from cattle . The objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) isolates from cattle. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was used to identify and compare the sequence types (STs) of 43 non-O157 STEC cattle isolates using the EcMLST database curated by the STEC Center at Michigan State University. For the 43 isolates, 19 STs were identified and 10 of those STs were novel compared to those in EcMLST. For the 43 isolates, 19 different serotypes were identified. STEC O22:H8, O174:H28 and O8:H19 were most common, and STEC O8 isolates were the most diverse, with seven different STs for isolates with that O group. STEC strains with O types identified in this study have been isolated from cattle by other researchers, as well as from cases of human gastroenteritis. Of the 10 novel STs identified, six were found to be closely related to previously identified STs, indicating that populations of non-O157 STEC in cattle are similar to those from other sources, including human clinical cases. Significance and Impact of the StudyThe foodborne pathogen Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a significant public health concern. One of the main reservoirs for STEC are cattle, which can directly or indirectly contribute to STEC in the food supply. The genetic subtype data presented here highlight the diversity of STEC that can be isolated from cattle. These results further our understanding of the ecology of STEC in the primary production environment, which is important for developing effective control measures to reduce this pathogen in the food supply.",15
"Synergistic interactions of begomoviruses with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (genus Crinivirus) in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatasL . Three hundred and ninety-four sweet potato accessions from Latin America and East Africa were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of begomoviruses, and 46 were found to be positive. All were symptomless in sweet potato and generated leaf curling and/or chlorosis in Ipomoea setosa. The five most divergent isolates, based on complete genome sequences, were used to study interactions with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), known to cause synergistic diseases with other viruses. Co-infections led to increased titres of begomoviruses and decreased titres of SPCSV in all cases, although the extent of the changes varied notably between begomovirus isolates. Symptoms of leaf curling only developed temporarily in combination with isolate StV1 and coincided with the presence of the highest begomovirus concentrations in the plant. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequence analysis revealed that co-infection of SPCSV with isolate StV1 led to relatively increased siRNA targeting of the central part of the SPCSV genome and a reduction in targeting of the genomic ends, but no changes to the targeting of StV1 relative to single infection of either virus. These changes were not observed in the interaction between SPCSV and the RNA virus Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (genus Potyvirus), implying specific effects of begomoviruses on RNA silencing of SPCSV in dually infected plants. Infection in RNase3-expressing transgenic plants showed that this protein was sufficient to mediate this synergistic interaction with DNA viruses, similar to RNA viruses, but exposed distinct effects on RNA silencing when RNase3 was expressed from its native virus, or constitutively from a transgene, despite a similar pathogenic outcome.",16
"Examining the impact of shade on above-ground biomass and normalized difference vegetation index of C-3 and C-4 grass species in North-Western NSW, Australia . Previous investigations have detected a directional trend in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of pastures around scattered paddock trees and identified shade from the tree as the most likely causal factor. This study uses a field experiment to quantify the effect of varying levels of shade on the above-ground biomass and NDVI of three grass species native to Australia (Microlaena stipoides, C-3, shade tolerant; Austrodanthonia richardsonii, C-3, prefers full sunlight, and Chloris ventricosa, C-4, prefers full sunlight) in different seasons. The study demonstrates that shade had little influence on the above-ground biomass of C-3 species but significantly reduced biomass in the C-4 species. Until early winter, the NDVI of each species was generally significantly higher in all shaded treatments than in the no-shade treatment. This suggests that shaded plants retained a higher proportion of green biomass and/or changed leaf shape, increased leaf area and chlorophyll content. Regardless, although not proven in this experiment, it is likely shade prolonged the retention of green plant material into mid to late winter. Overall, this experiment explains the directional trends in NDVI around scattered trees found in previous work and suggests that shade from scattered trees prolongs green pasture production in a range of native grass species, without loss of C-3 pasture biomass.",17
"Mid-infrared spectroscopy for discrimination and classification of Aspergillus spp. contamination in peanuts . In this study, Aspergillus spp., common colonists in peanut, were characterized, classified and quantified using FTIR coupled with ATR accessory. FTIR-ATR spectral data of infected peanut samples were preprocessed (mean-centering, smoothing the 1st derivative), and used for the PLS regression analysis for quantitative results. Very high R-2 values (96.20-99.98%) together with low error of RMSEC values (0.014-0.153 Log CFU/g of peanut) were obtained. Even, the spectrum of peanut matrix was dominant at early stages of invasion (4 Log CFU/g, species level separation (Aspergillus alliaceus, Aspergillus caelatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and Aspergillus tamari) was observed. The accuracy of correct classification increased proportionally with fungal invasion level and 100% correct classification was reached when the cell level was Log CFU/g = 4.5-5. Samples with similar secondary metabolites (toxin producers) grouped close-by in PC score diagrams for all levels of fungal growth. Results highlight the possible implementation of FTIR-ATR model to detect infected peanuts even at early stages of invasion; besides, to prove the potential separation capability in terms of species and their secondary metabolites.

"A Clinical Predictor Score for 30-Day Mortality among HIV-Infected Adults Hospitalized with Pneumonia in Uganda . Background Pneumonia is a major cause of mortality among HIV-infected patients. Pneumonia severity scores are promising tools to assist clinicians in predicting patients' 30-day mortality, but existing scores were developed in populations infected with neither HIV nor tuberculosis ( TB) and include laboratory data that may not be available in resource-limited settings. The objective of this study was to develop a score to predict mortality in HIV-infected adults with pneumonia in TB-endemic, resource-limited settings. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a prospective study enrolling HIV-infected adults with cough >= 2 weeks and 120 beats/minute, respiratory rate >30 breaths/minute, oxygen saturation <90%, and CD4 cell count <50 cells/mm(3). Patients' 30-day mortality, stratified by score, was: score 0 or 1, 12.6%, score 2 or 3, 23.4%, score 4, 53.9%. For each 1 point change in clinical predictor score, the odds of 30-day mortality increased by 65%(OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.39-1.96, p <0.001). Conclusions A simple, four-point scoring system can stratify patients by levels of risk for mortality. Rapid identification of higher risk patients combined with provision of timely and appropriate treatment may improve clinical outcomes. This predictor score should be validated in other resource-limited settings.",19
"Morphological, Thermal, and Mechanical Characterization of Sansevieria trifasciata Fibers . Sansevieria trifasciata is a common perennial plant which freely grows and widely found in homes, parks, and woodlands. In this research, we studied the morphology using Scanning Electron Microscope and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR); thermal properties using Thermogravimetric (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC) analyses; mechanical behavior through tensile tests of Sansevieria trifasciata fiber (STF) obtained from Butaleja in Eastern Uganda. Findings show that the fiber has an irregular cross-sectional shape with lumens in the center, the fiber diameter was between 80 and 120 mu m. TGA tests showed that the fiber is stable below 200 degrees C with maximum cellulose decomposition temperature of 315 degrees C. DSC showed that the fiber's crystallization temperature was 310.5 degrees C and lignin decomposition temperature of 372.7 degrees C. The surface functional groups were majorly of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin in direct correlation with research elsewhere on natural fibers.",20
"Impact of Anti-Retroviral Treatment and Cotrimoxazole Prophylaxis on Helminth Infections in HIV-Infected Patients in Lambarene, Gabon . Background Foci of the HIV epidemic and helminthic infections largely overlap geographically. Treatment options for helminth infections are limited, and there is a paucity of drug-development research in this area. Limited evidence suggests that antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces prevalence of helminth infections in HIV-infected individuals. We investigated whether ART exposure and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CTX-P) is associated with a reduced prevalence of helminth infections. Methodology and Principal Findings This cross-sectional study was conducted at a primary HIV-clinic in Lambarene, Gabon. HIV-infected adults who were ART-naive or exposed to ART for at least 3 months submitted one blood sample and stool and urine samples on 3 consecutive days. Outcome was helminth infection with intestinal helminths, Schistosoma haematobium, Loa loa or Mansonella perstans. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations between ART or CTX-P and helminth infection. In total, 408 patients were enrolled. Helminth infection was common (77/252 [30.5%]). Filarial infections were most prevalent (55/310 [17.7%]), followed by infection with intestinal helminths (35/296 [11.8%]) and S. haematobium (19/323 5.9%]). Patients on CTX-P had a reduced risk of Loa loa microfilaremia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.97, P = 0.04), also in the subgroup of patients on ART (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-0.96, P = 0.04). There was no effect of ART exposure on helminth infection prevalence. Conclusions/Significance CTX-P use was associated with a decreased risk of Loa loa infection, suggesting an anthelminthic effect of antifolate drugs. No relation between ART use and helminth infections was established.",21
"FCRL5 Delineates Functionally Impaired Memory B Cells Associated with Plasmodium falciparum Exposure . ""Exposure to Plasmodium falciparum is associated with circulating """"atypical"""" memory B cells (atMBCs), which appear similar to dysfunctional B cells found in HIV-infected individuals. Functional analysis of atMBCs has been limited, with one report suggesting these cells are not dysfunctional but produce protective antibodies. To better understand the function of malaria-associated atMBCs, we performed global transcriptome analysis of these cells, obtained from individuals living in an area of high malaria endemicity in Uganda. Comparison of gene expression data suggested down-modulation of B cell receptor signaling and apoptosis in atMBCs compared to classical MBCs. Additionally, in contrast to previous reports, we found upregulation of Fc receptor-like 5 (FCRL5), but not FCRL4, on atMBCs. Atypical MBCs were poor spontaneous producers of antibody ex vivo, and higher surface expression of FCRL5 defined a distinct subset of atMBCs compromised in its ability to produce antibody upon stimulation. Moreover, higher levels of P. falciparum exposure were associated with increased frequencies of FCRL5(+) atMBCs. Together, our findings suggest that FCLR5(+) identifies a functionally distinct, and perhaps dysfunctional, subset of MBCs in individuals exposed to P. falciparum.""",22
"The Lake Victoria island intervention study on worms and allergy-related diseases (LaVIISWA): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial . Background: The Hygiene Hypothesis proposes that infection exposure protects against inflammatory conditions. Helminths possess allergen-like molecules and may specifically modulate allergy-related immunological pathways to inhibit responses which protect against them. Mass drug administration is recommended for helminth-endemic communities to control helminth-induced pathology, but may also result in increased rates of inflammation-mediated diseases in resource-poor settings. Immunological studies integrated with implementation of helminth control measures may elucidate how helminth elimination contributes to ongoing epidemics of inflammatory diseases. We present the design of the Lake Victoria Island Intervention Study on Worms and Allergy-related diseases (LaVIISWA), a cluster-randomised trial evaluating the risks and benefits of intensive versus standard anthelminthic treatment for allergy-related diseases and other health outcomes. Methods/Design: The setting is comprised of island fishing communities in Mukono district, Uganda. Twenty-six communities have been randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard or intensive anthelminthic intervention for a three-year period. Baseline characteristics were collected immediately prior to intervention rollout, commenced in February 2013. Primary outcomes are reported wheeze in the past 12 months and atopy (skin prick test response and allergen-specific immunoglobulin (asIg) E concentration). Secondary outcomes are visible flexural dermatitis, helminth infections, haemoglobin, growth parameters, hepatosplenomegaly, and responses to vaccine antigens. The trial provides a platform for in-depth analysis of clinical and immunological consequences of the contrasting interventions. Discussion: The baseline survey has been completed successfully in a challenging environment. Baseline characteristics were balanced between trial arms. Prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni, hookworm, Strongyloides stercoralis and Trichuris trichiura was 52%, 23%, 13%, and 12%, respectively; 31% of Schistosoma mansoni infections were heavy (>400 eggs/gram). The prevalence of reported wheeze and positive skin prick test to any allergen was 5% and 20%, respectively. Respectively, 77% and 87% of participants had Dermatophagoides-and German cockroach-specific IgE above 0.35 kUA/L. These characteristics suggest that the LaVIISWA study will provide an excellent framework for investigating beneficial and detrimental effects of worms and their treatment, and the mechanisms of such effects.",23
"Trends in prevalence of selected opportunistic infections associated with HIV/AIDS in Uganda . Background: After more than a decade of establishing and expanding access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), empirical evidence on its impact on trends of opportunistic infections (OIs) associated with the deadly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in resource poor settings is scarce. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of HAART coverage on trends of five most common OIs in Uganda. Methods: Observational data from January 2002 to December 2013 for 5972 HIV positive individuals attending the AIDS Support Organisation (TASO) HIV/AIDS care programme in Uganda were extracted and analysed. Trends were analysed using autoregressive moving average time series and mixed effects linear regression models adjusting for all available potential confounders. Results: A total of 204,871 monthly medical reports were retrieved and analysed. Majority of the participants were female (73%) with a median age of 32 years (inter-quartile range 26-39). Overall, significant decreasing mean annual prevalence trends were observed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, herpes zoster, genital ulcer and oral candidiasis (p < 0.05, X-trend(2)). Non-significant declining mean annual prevalence trend was observed for cryptococcal meningitis (p = 0.181, X-trend(2)). The largest impact of HAART was observed in Oral candidiasis and TB whose average annual prevalence reduced by 61% and 43% respectively following the introduction of HAART. Monthly series for TB, Herpes zoster and genital ulcers differed significantly by age and clinic but only genital ulcer series differed significantly by sex (p < 0.05, kruskal wallis). After controlling for the effects of age, sex and clinic (fixed) and monthly clustering (random effect) in a mixed effects linear regression model, all the five OIs showed a significant monthly change in prevalence (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Overall, prevalence of most OIs declined especially after the introduction of HAART. However significant variations exist in the trends of different OIs in different geographical areas in Uganda. It is therefore important that site specific factors are properly identified to enable the development of targeted interventions.",24
